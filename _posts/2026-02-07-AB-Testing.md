A/B tests are used in business to describe a hypothesis test. An A/B Test is a randomised experiment containing two groups, A & B that receive different experiences. Within an A/B test, we look to understand and measure the response of each group.

Example of a Marketing Campaign Pilot:

Group 1 – customers received Mailer 1 (a basic cheaper version)
Group 2 – customers received Mailer 2 (a colourful more expensive version)
Group 3 = control group - received no Mailer at all

The marketing team is certain that customers who received a mailer (i.e. Groups 1 or 2) signed up more than the control group but are unsure whether the quality of mailer made a significant difference. We can answer this question using hypothesis testing, in particular the chi-square test for independence.
