Digital images are seen as arrays. In the first part of this post, I am going to use NumPy to crop an image (horizontally and/or vertically). Grayscale images can be thought of as a collection of pixels on a 2D grid. Colour images can therefore be thought of as a similar pixel collection, only that each pixel is now containing information on 3 aspects - those being the Red-Green-Blue colours.
